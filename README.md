- Issues: 1) Poorly RAM managenment, code is poorly wrriten 2) Ramdomdly unable to fetch weather information 2) Most of the Code has no comments 

This project received great help from Github user G6EJD https://github.com/G6EJD/ESP32-8266-ePaper-Serial-UART-Wx-Display and arduinojson https://arduinojson.org/v5/example/

The ESP8266 will fetch the weather information and news headlines from internet by accessing metoffice weather api https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint and https://newsapi.org/ api. Then the information will display by the 4.3 inch waveshare eink diaplay.
